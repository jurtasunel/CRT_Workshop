# Getting started with Github

Welcome to the Genomics CRT workshop. First things first, you will need to set up a github account! If you are viewing this page and do not have an account, you should see a prompt from Github like this: 

![github_sign_up_1](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/github_sign_up_1.png)

Click `sign up` and fill out your account information:

![github_sign_up_2](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/github_sign_up_2.png)

Click `Select Plan`, and coose the free plan.

You can skip the next step, or answer the questions to tailor suggestions by Github. Github will not flood your home page like a social media site would, so this step is largely optional. An email will be sent to your email address to confirm the registration.

![github_sign_up_5](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/github_sign_up_5.png)

You should now have created a Github account. To find the GenomicsCRT github page, search for the username in the search bar:

![github_sign_up_6](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/github_sign_up_6.png)

*Note: be sure to add the dash for Genomics-CRT*

![github_sign_up_7](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/images/blob/master/github_sign_up_7.png)

Follow the Github page. Any additions made to the `Genomics-CRT` page will show up on your home page.

# Posting questions
Due to the large amount of interest in the workshop, we have decided that offering assistance via Zoom is no longer feasible. Instead, we encourage you to post your questions to the repositories `issues` tab. The post will be publicly visible and will be useful for other participants to view if they are having the same issues. Furthermore, this will allow course coordinators to answer the questions outside of scheduled zoom hours. We will endeavour to answer your questions as quickly as possible!

When posting a question, be sure to make the post title descriptive and succinct. You may attach a label to the question such as `R help`, `Python help` or `software issue` -- you get the idea.

A nice feature Github offers is to upload a file to the issues post. You can post error logs with your post, or if you are having trouble loading a file we provide, attach the file in question to the post (you may have overwritten the file or changed the delimiters from comma to tab). This will allow us to debug your issue much faster.

This concludes the tutorial on setting up a github account. Feel free to search github for snippets of code, you will find a huge amount of resources freely available to use. You can also filter by the programming language used to filter for R or Python code. Enjoy!
